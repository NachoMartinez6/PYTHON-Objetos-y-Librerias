# Introduction To Python

Here we will see a basic introduction to the main objects in Python, which are fundamental to understand Python syntax and create different projects.

All you will see here is information collected throughout my learning process. Many of the notes are taken through Internet courses, videos on YouTube as well as many of the datasets come from the Kaggle platform.

All the best
